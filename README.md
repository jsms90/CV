# Jennifer Spencer - Full-stack Web Developer
I am a systems-thinker with a strong interest in functional programming, who values a user-centred approach to software development. My primary motivations lie with open source values & consideration of the inherent ethical implications of software development. This includes but is not limited to Tech for Good, the education sector and communication technologies.
